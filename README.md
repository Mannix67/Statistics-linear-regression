Sixteen male well-trained middle and long distance runners performed a 3 km time trial and a number of running tests in the laboratory including their running velocity (km.h-1) at a blood lactate concentration of 4 mmol.l-1 (v4mM) and at their Lactate Threshold (vTlac). All the laboratory testing took place on a motorised treadmill while distance running performance was determined by 3 km time trials on an indoor 200m track.


The aim is to investigate whether there is sufficient evidence of a dependency of 3 km running time on v-4mM in the population of male runners of of interest in order to use their blood lactate markers to predict their 3km running time.

# 1. Question of Interest
Describe the question you are trying to answer making specific reference to what the population of interest is.  State the hypothesis that you are testing and what will be considered as sufficient evidence to make a claim that blood lactate marker is a useful predictor of 3km running time in the population of interest. 

# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
Create suitable numerical and graphical summaries.  Use these summaries to provide your subjective impressions as to what you think the data are saying with respect to the question of interest.

# 3. Formal Analysis
Run a formal analysis that will allow you to answer the question you have posed in section 1.

# 4. Conclusion and Translation
Write a summary and a conclusion that is translatable to the sports scientist you are collaborating with.
